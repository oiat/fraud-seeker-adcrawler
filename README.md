# Fraud Seeker AdCrawler

## Project Description
The Fraud Seeker AdCrawler manages the extraction of search engine results for specific text snippets/phrases and thus helps us with the automated detection of fraudulent ads. By continuously monitoring search engines for phrases used by fraudulent websites, we can detect such fraudulent clusters as soon as they go online. The goal is to protect consumers from scams in search engines as soon as they are online.

The Meta AdCrawler accesses a Google Spreadsheet to be defined via the Google API and extracts the desired search terms from the "Search Terms" spreadsheet. A Google Chrome instance is then started with the Puppeteer Library, navigated to the Meta Ad Library and the first search term is entered there. After receiving the search response, the system navigates to the bottom of the page and extracts information from the individual advertising providers (name, account verfification status, number of followers, account creation date, account URL, number of ads for the given search term). The extracted information is displayed in the specified Google spreadsheet in the "Results" worksheet and can be analysed there.
Fraud Seeker was developed by [Ã–IAT (Austrian Institute for Applied Telecommunication)](https://oiat.at/) together with [XYLEM Technologies](https://www.xylem-technologies.com/) and realized with funds provided by [netidee](https://www.netidee.at/).
